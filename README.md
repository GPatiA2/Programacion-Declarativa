# Programacion-Declarativa

This repository contains the assignments of the subject "Programaci√≥n Declarativa" which I took during the third year studying at UCM.

It contains mainly Haskell and Prolog programs, but the most relevant content of the repository is located in the files "PracticaFinal.hs" and 
"PracticaFinal19-20.hs".

"PracticaFinal.hs" contains functions useful to determine properties of a given mathematical relation.

"PracticaFinal19-20.hs" contains functions that check for properties in a given graph, like hamiltonian cycles, equivalente and some others.
